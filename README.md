# SenseHub

This Python script let you download the data from your SenseHubÂ® Dairy device in an easy readable excel format.

To do it uses SenseHub APIs, you will have to login using your credentials the script will do the rest.

This first version only lets you either download the data from all yout herd or you can go cow by cow, by default it downloads health data with daily resolution, but it can be easily changed.

Maybe in the future there will be a "server" version that every week get the hourly dataand update the excel file so we can have more detailed data.
